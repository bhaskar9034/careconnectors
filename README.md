Our aim is to develop a digital system that streamlines the appointment scheduling process in hospitals by automating the process of identifying doctor availability and appointment slot allocation. The system allocates appointment slots based on the doctor's presence and the number of waitlisted patients. This will improve the overall patient experience by reducing the wait time. In conclusion, the proposed digital system will improve the efficiency and convenience of the appointment scheduling process in hospitals; the patients will benefit with reduced waiting time.
# Idea/Approach Details
```
The solution proposed here aims to streamline the scheduling and appointment allocation process in hospitals by harnessing the power of digital technology and AI integration.
This system optimizes doctor availability and enhances the  overall patient experience.
Here's an overview of the idea👇
● Patient-Centric Approach
● Doctor Availability Optimization
● Real-time Updates
● Data Integration
● Machine Learning for Predictive Maintenance
● Scalability
● Feedback Loop
● Data Security and Privacy
```
## **Use Cases**
⮚ In this website, patient can `Schedule Appointment` with the doctor for the respective problem.<br />
⮚ Also `View Doctor’s Availability.`<br />
⮚ The Hospital staff will `Allocate Appointment` to the people.<br />
⮚ After the allocation it will `Notify the time to Patient.`<br />
